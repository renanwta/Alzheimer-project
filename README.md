# Alzheimer-project
## 1. Introduction

  Commonly known as the memory loss disease, Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that gradually causes patients to lose their memory over time. In more advanced stages, it can also alter emotions, personality, and social behavior. Although people typically become aware of this disease after the worsening of milder symptoms, it is possible to observe the probability of an individual developing the disease based on their physiological and routine characteristics. To achieve this, public data containing these characteristics of patients and whether or not they had the disease were used. The data was sourced from the public database Kaggle.com, and according to the author, the data has not undergone any preprocessing and contains only the patients' responses. Additionally, for a better understanding of the model creation process, the CRISP-DM methodology, which consists of six main stages for developing a data science project, was employed.

## 4. Problem Statement and Project's Goals
4.1 Project's Goal

  The goal of this project was to create a predictive model capable of detecting the possible presence of Alzheimer's disease using data such as demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, medical history, functional and cognitive assessments, as well as patient symptoms. This allows the model to identify whether a patient is likely to develop the disease even in the absence of milder symptoms, before the onset of more advanced symptoms or a medical consultation.

  The purpose of this project is to bring the approach closer to real-world applications by including data treatment, preprocessing, model creation, tuning, and deployment.

4.2 Benefit

  The main benefit is the potential for individuals to identify the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease in advance (Note: It is important to emphasize that this project is intended for study purposes only, and any results generated from personal data should never be taken as the sole truth. If you have any concerns, please consult a specialized medical professional). Additionally, this model can provide an extra layer of interpretation for a doctorâ€™s diagnosis regarding the presence of the disease

</div>

* The final model, after creating the pipeline, achieved good results with an average accuracy of 94%, and precision and recall for patients with the disease of 93% and 92%, respectively. Moreover, these values are accurate given that our dataset has a significant imbalance between patients, with a higher number of individuals without the disease compared to those with it.

* The confusion matrix visually demonstrates that our model has the ability to distinguish new data effectively. Additionally, together with the data obtained from the classifier report, we can see that the precision and recall percentages are validated based on the matrix.
